## Annexe

This is my version of the project 7 of the web developper formation from OpenClassrooms. 

I started it on 05/03/2022 and finished it on 05/23/2022. The goal is to use everything that we learn during this training in one project and still learn new topics as MySql, one of its ORM (here, I chose Sequelize) and a front framework (VueJs v2) (we only used HTML/CSS/JavaScript before).
