# Groupomania Social Network

## Description

Groupomania is a large distribution group that wants to build an intern social network. The goal here is to open the exchange between employees and improve their work environment. They want to have the possibility to post text (as you do in reddit for example), but also images (like in 9gag).

To navigate in the forum, you have to be logged in. If the user is not connected, they can reach the login page or the signup page. To sign up, you will need to provide :
- An email
- Your first name
- Your last name
- A password that contains a minimum of eight characters and at least one number

Once you are logged in, you can reach differents pages :
- All posts page, where you can see all the posts of the forum from the newest to the oldest.
- Last participations posts, where you can see all the posts but the order includes the last commented post as well. So if someone just commented on a post that was created a few times ago, you'll see the post on the top of that page. 
- The post page, where you'll see the post with all its comments. The user can comment as well through this page.
- A profile page, with all the user's info. Through this page, the user can change their profile picture or delete their account. 
- The create post page, where the user can create a new post (text required, possibility to add an image) and publish it.

Functionalities :
- Once you are logged in, a session has been created. You can refresh your page and still be connected.
- The log out button is reachable in the header of the site. 
- You can delete your account, your post and your comment.
- If you are an admin, you can delete any account, any post and any comment. The admin has access to a hidden page where all the users are listed. They can delete an account through this page.

## Annexe

This is my version of the project 7 of the web developper formation from OpenClassrooms. 

I started it on 05/03/2022 and finished it on 05/23/2022. The goal is to use everything that we learn during this training in one project and still learn new topics as MySql, one of its ORM (here, I chose Sequelize) and a front framework (VueJs v2) (we only used HTML/CSS/JavaScript before).
